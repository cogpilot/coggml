# Distributed Cognitive Architecture for ggml-org-central

This project transforms the ggml-org-central repository into a distributed network of agentic cognitive grammar, implementing a self-aware cognitive flow that serves as both a technical architecture and a living diagram of emergent intelligence.

## Overview

The distributed cognitive system represents a paradigm shift from traditional tensor computation to an ecosystem of autonomous agents, each operating as a kernel of cognitive grammar. These agents exchange tensor-shaped data structures to realize emergent intelligence through recursive coordination.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.14+
- C/C++ compiler with C99 support
- Math library support

### Building

```bash
# Clone and build the main project
cd ggml
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j8

# Run the cognitive agents demo
./bin/cognitive-agents-demo
```

## Architecture Components

### 🧠 Core Subsystems

1. **Memory System**: Distributed Hypergraph AtomSpace (Tensorized)
   - Hypergraph knowledge representation using ggml tensors
   - Distributed storage across multiple backends
   - Semantic indexing and retrieval

2. **Task System**: Agentic Task Orchestrator (Recursive, Symbolic+Neural)
   - Grammar-constrained task decomposition
   - Recursive execution planning
   - Integration with GBNF grammars

3. **AI System**: Hybrid Reasoning Engine (PLN + MOSES + Pattern Matcher)
   - Probabilistic Logic Networks for belief reasoning
   - Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolution
   - Pattern matching via tensor operations

4. **Autonomy System**: Self-Modifying ECAN Attention Economy
   - Economic attention allocation
   - Performance-based resource management
   - Recursive self-improvement

### 🌐 Distributed Communication

The system leverages and extends the existing ggml RPC infrastructure:

- **Tensor Membrane Exchange**: Cognitive states as serialized tensor packets
- **Attention Routing**: Messages routed based on salience and relevance
- **Meta-Cognitive Headers**: Enhanced RPC with cognitive metadata

## Key Features

### 🔄 Recursive Intelligence
- Agents model other agents' cognitive states
- Meta-reasoning about reasoning processes
- Self-improvement through recursive optimization

### 🏗️ Emergent Architecture
- Spontaneous role specialization
- Adaptive communication patterns
- Hierarchical structures from flat networks

### 💡 Cognitive Grammar

```

The demo includes:
- **Philosopher Agent**: Specializes in consciousness concepts
- **Scientist Agent**: Focuses on neuroscience perspective
- **Collaborative Reasoning**: Cross-agent knowledge exchange
- **Attention Management**: Dynamic resource allocation

### Example Output
```
=== Consciousness Exploration Demo ===
Created cognitive agent 1751328539001 at localhost:8001
Created cognitive agent 1751328539002 at localhost:8002

Adding knowledge to agents...
Added knowledge: consciousness (nodes: 1)
Added knowledge: philosophy_of_mind (nodes: 2)
Added knowledge: neuroscience (nodes: 1)

Simulating consciousness exploration...
Allocated 0.60 attention to type 3 (total: 0.60/1.00)
Agent 1751328539001 sent cognitive tensor (type 1, attention 0.80, salience 0.56)
```

## Cognitive Grammar Examples

### Task Decomposition
```gbnf
task(solve_consciousness_question)
preconditions(
    knowledge(consciousness, embedding_1),
    tensor_similarity(tensor_1, tensor_2, 0.7)
)
decomposition(
    task(gather_definitions),
    task(analyze_perspectives),
    task(synthesize_answer)
)
postconditions(
    belief(consciousness_understood, 0.8, 0.7)
)
```

### Reasoning Patterns
```gbnf
deduction(
    premise1(belief(humans_conscious, 0.9, 0.95)),
    premise2(relation(consciousness, requires, self_awareness, 0.8)),
    conclusion(belief(humans_self_aware, 0.8, 0.9)),
    strength(0.85)
)
```

### Attention Allocation
```gbnf
allocate(
    amount(0.4),
    target(memory),
    priority(high),
    duration(5000ms)
)
```

## Integration with Existing ggml Components

- Cognitive tensor packets with attention metadata
- Salience-based message routing
- Performance monitoring and feedback

### Grammar System
Leverages llama.cpp's GBNF system for:
- Cognitive grammar validation
- Constrained reasoning generation
- Task decomposition rules

### Backend Abstraction
Utilizes ggml's backend system for:
- Distributed cognitive computation
- Specialized reasoning backends
- Economic resource allocation
